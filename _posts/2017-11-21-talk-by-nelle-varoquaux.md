As some of you are aware, we have recently started PyLadies Hyderabad ([http://pyladies.hydpy.org/](http://pyladies.hydpy.org/)), an initiative to cultivate a more female-friendly environment in python and open source community. However, we are open to everyone (not just women).

We are thrilled to announce our first meetup which is going to happen on **25th of November (11:00 AM - 1:30 PM)** at Thoughtworks by Nelle Varoquaux.

Nelle Varoquaux ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelle-varoquaux-63250a34/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelle-varoquaux-63250a34/)) received a PhD in computational biology from Ã‰cole des Mines de Paris in 2015. She is a core developer of scikit-learn, MarkUs and Matplotlib. She was Program Chair for Scipy in 2015 and 2016. Her research interests are in statistical machine learning and scientific computing applied to molecular biology problems.

Also, we would like to thank

- Thoughtworks for the venue.
- Dr. Prabhu Ramachandran (Department of Aerospace Engineering,IIT Bombay) for connecting us with Nelle Varoquaux.
- Asokan Pichai for helping us coordinate the speaker logistics for the event. Asokan heads L&D at TalentSprint and has provided space for regular Hydpy meetups.
